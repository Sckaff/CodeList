## Notes
The app was fairly easy to make considering my background knowledge (even though very limited). Still, I need more knowledge of Kotlin to be able to delete specific itemViews based on where the long press was made. I've heard it is bad practice to include listeners on the adapter's "onBindViewHolder" function, so I must find out what is the best practice, and how to seemingly go between UI interaction and recyclerview's items. Exciting stuff ahead!
